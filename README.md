# BARBE

This repository contains the code for "Explaining Decisions of Black-box Models using BARBE" paper.
**B**lack-box **A**ssocaition **R**ule-**B**ased **E**xplanation (**BARBE**) is a model-independent framework that can explain 
the decisions of any black-box classifier for tabular datasets with high-precision. 

We rely on the rules provided by SigDirect (the associative classifier we leveraged in BARBE) to explain
each decision of a black-box model. 

Our framework is built on top of the LIME framework by Ribeiro et al.
